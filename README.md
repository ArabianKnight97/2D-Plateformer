Description:
This platformer game combines dynamic combat, procedural level generation, and a branching ability system for a rich player experience. Players control Bean Guy, progressing through increasingly challenging levels filled with enemies and obstacles. The game uses a roguelike structure, ensuring replayability through randomized level layouts and item drops. Players begin by choosing one of three class-defining magical beans—Brutalist, Alchemist, or Bullseye—each offering unique combat styles and abilities. This selection influences the player's ability tree, where progression allows for upgrades to base stats and unlocks class-specific or hybrid abilities.

Movement and combat are core to gameplay, requiring precision, timing, and adaptability. Players can customize their playstyle by investing in different ability trees, unlocking powerful skills and improving combat effectiveness. The game also features a hybrid system, where players can combine abilities from multiple classes to create unique strategies. Boss encounters, environmental challenges, and resource management contribute to the complexity of gameplay, keeping the player engaged and encouraging replayability through varying strategies.
